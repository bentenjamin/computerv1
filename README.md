a simple polynomial equation solver for linear and quadratic equations

It will always be considered that the input is well formatted, ie.  all terms are ofthe format a*X^b. The powers are well ordered and all present

features:
    highest degree is 2
    spaces or no spaces
    implicit multiplication of coefficient (can be written ax)
    upper or lower case X
    implicit degree of 1
    implicit coefficient of 1
    lexicon checking
    reduced form output
    fraction coefficients

quadratic_example = "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
linear_example =  "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 4 * X^0"
