It will always be considered that the input is well formatted, ie.  all terms are ofthe formaâˆ—xp. The powers are well ordered and all present

highest degree is 2
equation is string

bonuses:
    input error catching
    manage inputs outputs in a natural form
    Display the solution(s) under the form of irrational fractions when it is interesting.
    Display intermediate steps.

output:
    reduced equation
    degree of equation
    solution and sign of discriminant

stuff:
    degree of equation is largest exponent between all terms excluding constants

quadratic_example = "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
linear_example =  "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 = 4 * X^0"
